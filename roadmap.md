# Automated Data Extraction and Invoice Management: Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a React-based web application for automating data extraction, processing, and managing invoice data from various file formats. The app will organize the extracted data into three main tabs: **Invoices**, **Products**, and **Customers**. The app must use React Redux for centralized state management, ensuring real-time synchronization across tabs. It also includes AI-based solutions for data extraction and validation features for error handling.

## Milestones and Tasks

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Task 1.1**: Set up a Git repository for version control.
- **Task 1.2**: Initialize a new React project using `create-react-app`.
- **Task 1.3**: Install necessary dependencies:
  - `redux` and `react-redux` for state management.
  - `axios` for API integration (if needed).
  - `tesseract.js` or similar library for OCR (PDF/image processing).
  - `papaparse` for CSV/Excel parsing.
  - `styled-components` or `tailwindcss` for styling (optional).
  - `formik` and `yup` for form validation.
  - `vercel-cli` for deployment.

---

### **2. File Uploads and AI-Based Data Extraction**
- **Task 2.1**: Design a file upload component to accept Excel, PDF, and image files.
- **Task 2.2**: Implement a service for handling file uploads and type detection.
- **Task 2.3**: Build AI-based extraction logic:
  - Use `tesseract.js` for extracting text from images or PDFs.
  - Use `papaparse` to parse Excel files.
  - Identify relevant fields (serial number, customer name, product details, tax, etc.) and organize them.
- **Task 2.4**: Create mock test cases for validating data extraction.

---

### **3. Tabbed Structure for Data Organization**
- **Task 3.1**: Design a tabbed layout using React components.
- **Task 3.2**: Create the **Invoices Tab**:
  - Include a table with the following columns: Serial Number, Customer Name, Product Name, Quantity, Tax, Total Amount, Date.
- **Task 3.3**: Create the **Products Tab**:
  - Include a table with the following columns: Name, Quantity, Unit Price, Tax, Price with Tax (optional: Discount).
- **Task 3.4**: Create the **Customers Tab**:
  - Include a table with the following columns: Customer Name, Phone Number, Total Purchase Amount.

---

### **4. Centralized State Management**
- **Task 4.1**: Set up a Redux store and slices for invoices, products, and customers.
- **Task 4.2**: Implement actions and reducers to handle updates for each tab.
- **Task 4.3**: Ensure real-time synchronization:
  - Changes in the **Products Tab** reflect in the **Invoices Tab**.
  - Changes in the **Customers Tab** reflect in the **Invoices Tab**.

---

### **5. Validation and Error Handling**
- **Task 5.1**: Validate extracted data for completeness and accuracy.
- **Task 5.2**: Handle unsupported file formats with user feedback.
- **Task 5.3**: Highlight missing fields and provide user-friendly prompts for corrections.

---

### **6. Code Quality and Documentation**
- **Task 6.1**: Write modular and reusable components.
- **Task 6.2**: Comment on complex functions and logic.
- **Task 6.3**: Document AI-based data extraction features in a `README.md` file.

---

### **7. Testing**
- **Task 7.1**: Create test cases for data extraction from various file types.
- **Task 7.2**: Test state updates and synchronization across tabs.
- **Task 7.3**: Capture screenshots/videos for solved test cases.

---

### **8. Deployment**
- **Task 8.1**: Configure Vercel for deployment.
- **Task 8.2**: Deploy the app and test functionality in the production environment.
